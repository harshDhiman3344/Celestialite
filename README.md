# Celestialite 🛰️🛰️
Hey!, This is a live 3D simulation of the globe with the top 100 satellites statically added to it
I used the TLEs (Two line elements) which is a type of data for each orbital satellite that provides infomation
about its current position aove the surface of earth.

TLE is a fixed data for each satellite and is created when the orbit is defined.

This simualation shows the top 100 satelltes as white dots
and the Active Starlink satellites as blue dots aobe the sky 🌃

the starlinks are fetched via an API call dynamically


## Search system 🔍
 
you can add the satellites dynamically by searching them in the search bar provided above
the search bar will add the satellte as a Yellow dot after fetching the top satellite from an API call.


## Tech Stack 💻

THREEjs (For the models)
React + Vite (the framework of the webpage)
JSON formatted static data and API response.
